Also, holding other factors constant, the log wage of a worker between 30 and 35 will decrease by 0.039 in reference to a worker older than 35. Both the coefficients are negative, which means a worker older than 35 is gainig more log wage. Also, the coefficient for a worker younger than 35 is smaller than the coefficient of a worker between 30 and 35.
