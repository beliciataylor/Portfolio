_My portfolio of projects_

Descriptions of folders and their projects:

## ECON485: Empirical Methods and Machine Learning
_Emory University Spring 2020_

This course was a continuation of an undergraduate econometrics course that further explored the multiple linear regression model and covered model selection techniques. Topics included resampling methods, selection criteria, subset selection, shrinkage methods, classification methods, and unsupervised learning. The folder contains my weekly assignments pertaining to each of the listed topics along with my lecture notes.

## ECON321: Econometrics
_Emory University Fall 2019_

This folder contains Jupyter notebook versions of my Econometrics assignments. Topics include regression analysis, multicolinearity, OLS, inference, and more. My final project for the course titled _Pregnancy Habits and Child Birth Weights_ is also included. Originally, the assignments were submitted as RMarkdown files, and these files can also be found in the RMarkdown folder.
