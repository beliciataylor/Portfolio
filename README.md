Descriptions of folders and their projects:

## Undergraduate Assessments
Contains all my coding assignments and finals projects throughout my undergraduate education at Emory College of Arts and Sciences. The name of the folder indicates the class the assignment was from.

* ECON485: Empirical Methods and Machine Learning

This course was a continuation of an undergraduate econometrics course that further explored the multiple linear regression model and covered model selection techniques. Topics included resampling methods, selection criteria, subset selection, shrinkage methods, classification methods, and unsupervised learning. The folder contains my weekly assignments pertaining to each of the listed topics.

* ECON321: Econometrics

Since my econometrics class used RMarkdown to submit assignments and our final project, I thought it best to publish my work on my [data science website](https://belledata.rbind.io/categories/undergraduate-econometrics/), which fully renders RMarkdown files. The RMarkdown files associated with the posts are located at my [belledata repository](https://github.com/beliciataylor/belledata/tree/master/content/post).
