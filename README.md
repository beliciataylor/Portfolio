Descriptions of folders and their projects:

## ECON485: Empirical Methods and Machine Learning

This course was a continuation of an undergraduate econometrics course that further explored the multiple linear regression model and covered model selection techniques. Topics included resampling methods, selection criteria, subset selection, shrinkage methods, classification methods, and unsupervised learning. The folder contains my weekly assignments pertaining to each of the listed topics along with my lecture notes.

## ECON321: Econometrics (External Link)

Since my econometrics class used RMarkdown to submit assignments and our final project, I thought it best to publish my work on my [data science website](https://belledata.rbind.io/categories/undergraduate-econometrics/), which fully renders RMarkdown files. The RMarkdown files associated with the posts are located at my [belledata repository](https://github.com/beliciataylor/belledata/tree/master/content/post).
