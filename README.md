# Portfolio
_My portfolio of projects including classwork from Econometrics, Machine Learning, etc_

## ECON485: Empirical Methods and Machine Learning
_Emory University Spring 2020_

This course was a continuation of an undergraduate econometrics course that further explored the multiple linear regression model and covered model selection techniques. Topics included resampling methods, selection criteria, subset selection, shrinkage methods, classification methods, and unsupervised learning. The folder contains my weekly assignments pertaining to each of the listed topics along with my lecture notes.

## ECON321: Econometrics
_Emory University Fall 2019_

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks of my econometrics assignments. Topics include regression analysis, multicolinearity, OLS, inference, and more. I've also included my final project for the course titled _Pregnancy Habits and Child Birth Weights_. Originally, the assignments were submitted as RMarkdown files, and these files can also be found in the RMarkdown folder.

## ECON496RW: Independent Research
_Emory University Fall 2019_

For my final research project paper on _Historical Development of Refugee Crises & Aid Response_, I analyzed the refugee population statistics using the "unhcr_popstats.csv" dataset, which can be found at the [UNHCR refugee statistics website](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=R1xq) and as a csv file in this repository. The first five pages of my paper, which includes a section on this data analysis, can also be found on my website: (TBD)
